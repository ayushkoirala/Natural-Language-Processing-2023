|   Topic   |  A Fast and Accurate Dependency Parser using Neural Network   |
| Problem Statement | The problem with current dependency parsers is that they classify based on millions of sparse indicator features, which results in poor generalization and slow parsing speed due to the high cost of feature computation. The need for a solution is to find a more efficient and effective way of classifying in a greedy, transition-based dependency parser. |
