| Topic  | Improving Text Auto-Completion with Next Phrase Prediction |
| --- | --- |
| Hypothesis Question | Does the proposed intermediate training strategy improve the adaptability and performance of pre-trained language models like GPT-2 in text auto-completion for specific domains(i.e Computer Science, medical)? |
| --- | --- |
| Key Related Work | ##1. "Evaluation of Deep Neural Models for Text Auto-Completion Performance": This work could compare the performance of different deep neural models, including the ones mentioned in the original text, on the text auto-completion task. It could explore factors such as accuracy, efficiency, and scalability of these models, and provide insights on their strengths and weaknesses for this task. ##2. "Challenges in Adapting Deep Neural Models for Text Auto-Completion in Specific Domains: A Case Study of Academic Writing": This work could focus on the difficulties of adapting these models to specific domains, such as academic writing, as mentioned in the original text. It could examine the impact of domain-specific training corpus size, domain-specific language patterns, and domain-specific writing styles on the performance of these models. Additionally, this work could propose solutions to overcome these challenges and enhance the adaptability of these models to specific domains."  |
